// How this copy of OpenScreen was installed, and therefore WHO is allowed to update it.
//
// On the Microsoft Store, Flathub, Snap and Nix the package manager already updates the app.
// A second updater there is not merely redundant: inside an MSIX container the install
// directory is read-only, and on the Store a "download the .exe" prompt walks the user into a
// SECOND, parallel installation that then drifts from the Store copy forever. So the rule is
// not "try and fail gracefully", it is "do not offer it at all".
//
// One definition, so "may we update ourselves?" can never be asked two different ways.
